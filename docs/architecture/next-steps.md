# Next Steps

This backend architecture document provides the foundation for:

1. **Development Phase:** Implementation of services, repositories, and API endpoints
2. **Frontend Architecture:** Separate document for React frontend integration
3. **Schema Implementation:** Creation of TypeDB schemas and Pydantic generation tooling
4. **Security Implementation:** OAuth provider setup and JWT token management
5. **Testing Setup:** BDD test infrastructure with multi-database support
6. **Deployment Preparation:** Container orchestration and CI/CD pipeline setup

The architecture supports the V0.7 MVP requirements while providing a scalable foundation for future versions including advanced AI features, enhanced collaboration, and domain-specific knowledge base extensions.
