# Epic 5: Knowledge Graph Visualization & Editing (V0.7-V1)

**Epic Goal:** Create an intuitive, interactive graph visualization that allows users to directly manipulate knowledge structures.

## Story 5.1: Interactive Graph Visualization (V0.7)
**As a domain expert, I want to visualize my knowledge graph so that I can understand relationships between entities.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Graph displays entities as nodes and relationships as edges
- Users can zoom and pan to navigate large graphs
- Visual indicators show entity completeness and importance
- Graph renders smoothly with up to 500 nodes

### Deliverables:
- React Flow integration
- Graph data visualization
- Zoom and pan controls
- Visual completeness indicators

## Story 5.2: Direct Graph Manipulation (V0.7)
**As a domain expert, I want to directly manipulate the graph by adding, moving, and connecting entities so that I can build my knowledge structure visually.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Users can drag entities to reposition them with grid snapping
- New relationships can be created by dragging between entities
- Entities can be selected individually or in groups
- Graph manipulations update the underlying data immediately

### Deliverables:
- Direct manipulation controls
- Grid snapping system
- Relationship creation tools
- Selection and multi-selection functionality

## Story 5.3: In-graph Property Editing (V0.7)
**As a domain expert, I want to edit entity and relationship properties directly in the graph so that I can quickly update information.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Entity labels can be edited directly by double-clicking
- Short descriptions can be edited in-place
- Property changes are validated and saved automatically
- Visual feedback indicates editing state

### Deliverables:
- In-place editing functionality
- Property validation system
- Visual editing indicators
- Auto-save for property changes

## Story 5.4: Auto-layout Functionality (V1)
**As a domain expert, I want to use auto-layout functionality so that I can automatically organize my graph for better readability.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Auto-layout algorithms organize graph nodes automatically
- Multiple layout options are available for different use cases
- Layout transitions are animated smoothly
- Users can customize layout parameters

### Deliverables:
- Auto-layout algorithms
- Layout option selection
- Animated layout transitions
- Layout customization controls
