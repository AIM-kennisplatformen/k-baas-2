# Story 1.1a: Basic Repository Structure Setup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a well-organized repository structure with clear project boundaries,
**so that** I can efficiently navigate and maintain the codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Repository has a clear root-level directory structure with separate frontend and backend folders
2. README.md exists with project overview, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines
3. .gitignore is configured for both Node.js and Python artifacts
4. Directory structure follows monorepo best practices
5. Documentation folder structure is established with placeholder files

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Create Root Directory Structure (AC: 1, 4)
- [ ] Create `frontend/` directory for React 19 application
- [ ] Create `backend/` directory for Python FastAPI application
- [ ] Create `docs/` directory for project documentation
- [ ] Create `.github/` directory for GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] Create `scripts/` directory for build and deployment scripts
- [ ] Create `tests/` directory for integration and end-to-end tests
- [ ] Verify directory structure follows monorepo best practices

### Task 2: Setup Documentation Structure (AC: 5)
- [ ] Create `docs/architecture/` directory with placeholder index.md
- [ ] Create `docs/api/` directory for API documentation
- [ ] Create `docs/user-guides/` directory for user documentation
- [ ] Create `docs/development/` directory for development guides
- [ ] Create placeholder files in each docs subdirectory
- [ ] Create `docs/README.md` explaining documentation structure

### Task 3: Create Comprehensive README.md (AC: 2)
- [ ] Add project title and description
- [ ] Add project overview and goals
- [ ] Add technology stack information (React 19, FastAPI, TypeDB)
- [ ] Add prerequisites section (Node.js, Python 3.14, etc.)
- [ ] Add setup instructions for frontend development
- [ ] Add setup instructions for backend development
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines and coding standards
- [ ] Add project structure explanation
- [ ] Add links to detailed documentation
- [ ] Add license and contact information

### Task 4: Configure .gitignore (AC: 3)
- [ ] Add Node.js specific ignores (node_modules/, dist/, build/)
- [ ] Add Python specific ignores (__pycache__/, *.pyc, .env, venv/)
- [ ] Add IDE specific ignores (.vscode/, .idea/, *.swp)
- [ ] Add OS specific ignores (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
- [ ] Add log files ignores (*.log, logs/)
- [ ] Add temporary files ignores (tmp/, temp/)
- [ ] Add environment files ignores (.env.*, config.local.*)
- [ ] Test .gitignore configuration with sample files

### Task 5: Create Essential Project Files (AC: 1, 4)
- [ ] Create `package.json` placeholder in root for workspace management
- [ ] Create `pyproject.toml` placeholder in root for Python project management
- [ ] Create `LICENSE` file (if applicable)
- [ ] Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` with development workflow
- [ ] Create `.editorconfig` for consistent code formatting
- [ ] Create basic `docker-compose.yml` structure for development

### Task 6: Setup Version Control Best Practices (AC: 1)
- [ ] Create `.gitattributes` for line ending consistency
- [ ] Setup initial git hooks structure in `.githooks/`
- [ ] Create branch protection guidelines in docs
- [ ] Document git workflow in CONTRIBUTING.md

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure Information
Since architecture documents are not yet available, the following structure is based on the epic requirements and modern monorepo best practices:

**Monorepo Structure:**
- Frontend and backend are separate but coordinated
- Shared documentation and tooling at root level
- Clear separation of concerns between components

**Technology Stack (from Epic 1):**
- Frontend: React 19, Vite 7.0+, Tailwind CSS 4.0+, Shadcn/ui
- Backend: Python 3.14+, FastAPI
- Database: TypeDB (for knowledge graph)
- Package Management: npm (frontend), pip/poetry (backend)

**Development Environment:**
- Node.js 20.19+ / 22.12+ (for Vite 7.0 compatibility)
- Python 3.14+
- Git for version control
- GitHub for repository hosting and project management

### Testing
Since testing architecture documents are not available yet:
- Plan for unit tests in each component directory
- Integration tests in root-level `tests/` directory
- Test configuration will be established in subsequent stories
- Consider Jest for frontend, pytest for backend

### File Locations
Based on monorepo best practices:
- Frontend code: `frontend/src/`
- Backend code: `backend/src/` or `backend/app/`
- Shared documentation: `docs/`
- Configuration files: Root level
- GitHub workflows: `.github/workflows/`
