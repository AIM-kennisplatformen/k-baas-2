# Goal, Objective and Context

The Knowledge Graph Wiki Tool aims to solve a critical gap in knowledge management tools for domain experts. While traditional wikis offer rich content capabilities but lack structured relationship representation, and graph databases provide powerful relationship modeling but require technical expertise, this tool will combine the strengths of both approaches in an intuitive interface.

**Primary Objective:** Create a web-based platform that enables non-technical domain experts to collaboratively build, visualize, and share interconnected knowledge through an integrated wiki and knowledge graph interface.

**Key Business Goals:**
1. Empower domain experts to create and maintain complex knowledge structures without requiring technical skills
2. Facilitate knowledge discovery through relationship visualization and AI-assisted suggestions
3. Enable real-time collaboration among teams of experts
4. Improve knowledge completeness and quality through structured tracking of information gaps

**Context:**
- Target users are domain experts with specialized knowledge but limited technical expertise
- Users work in collaborative teams where knowledge sharing is essential
- The system must use TypeDB as the backend knowledge graph database
- The interface must be intuitive, minimalistic, and beautiful
- AI assistance must enhance user capabilities without removing user agency or control

This tool will allow users to create wiki pages with rich text and media, while simultaneously building a structured knowledge graph where entities and their relationships are visually represented. The bidirectional synchronization between these views will ensure consistency and provide multiple ways to interact with the same knowledge base.

*Important:* We annotate each requirement with V0.7, V1, V2, V3 and V?. These are version-indicators.
