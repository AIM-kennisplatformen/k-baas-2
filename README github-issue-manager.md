# GitHub Issue Manager

A consolidated command-line tool for managing GitHub issues, project boards, and issue relationships in BMAD (Business Modeling & Agent Development) workflows.

## Overview

This tool consolidates all GitHub issue management functionality from the `.bmad-core/scripts/github/` directory into a single, easy-to-use script with sub-commands. It provides comprehensive issue management capabilities including:

- **Epic, Story, and Task Creation**: Create hierarchical issues with automatic labeling and relationships
- **Project Board Management**: Automatically manage GitHub Projects v2 boards with proper status tracking
- **Issue Relationships**: Create and manage sub-issue relationships between epics, stories, and tasks
- **Status Management**: Update issue statuses with project board synchronization
- **Markdown Migration**: Migrate existing Markdown story files to GitHub issues
- **Story Listing**: List and filter stories with advanced search capabilities
- **Validation**: Validate script outputs and operations

## Workflow Examples

### Complete Epic Creation Workflow

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# 1. Create an epic
EPIC_RESULT=$(./github-issue-manager.sh create-epic "Epic 3: Data Management" "
This epic covers all data-related functionality including:
- Database design and setup
- Data models and relationships
- Data validation and integrity
- Backup and recovery procedures
" "data-management")

EPIC_NUM=$(echo "$EPIC_RESULT" | jq -r '.epic_number')
echo "Created Epic #$EPIC_NUM"

# 2. Create stories for the epic
STORY1_RESULT=$(./github-issue-manager.sh create-story $EPIC_NUM "Database Schema Design" "
## Story
As a developer, I want a well-designed database schema so that data is properly organized and performant.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Entity relationship diagram created
- [ ] Primary and foreign keys defined
- [ ] Indexes planned for performance
- [ ] Migration scripts prepared
" "data-management" "db-schema-design")

STORY1_NUM=$(echo "$STORY1_RESULT" | jq -r '.story_number')
echo "Created Story #$STORY1_NUM"

# 3. Create tasks for the story
./github-issue-manager.sh create-task $STORY1_NUM "Create ER Diagram" "
Design entity relationship diagram showing all tables, relationships, and constraints.
" "data-management" "db-schema-design"

./github-issue-manager.sh create-task $STORY1_NUM "Write Migration Scripts" "
Create database migration scripts for initial schema setup.
" "data-management" "db-schema-design"

# 4. Start working on the epic
./github-issue-manager.sh update-status $EPIC_NUM "In Progress"

echo "Epic workflow created successfully!"
```

### Bulk Issue Status Updates

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Move all completed tasks to Done status
COMPLETED_TASKS=(17 18 19 20)

for task in "${COMPLETED_TASKS[@]}"; do
    echo "Updating task #$task to Done..."
    ./github-issue-manager.sh update-status $task "Done"
done

# Move stories ready for review
REVIEW_STORIES=(16 21)

for story in "${REVIEW_STORIES[@]}"; do
    echo "Moving story #$story to Done..."
    ./github-issue-manager.sh update-status $story "Done"
done
```

### Story Creation from Template

```bash
#!/bin/bash

create_user_story() {
    local epic_num=$1
    local epic_slug=$2
    local feature_name=$3
    local story_slug=$4
    local user_type=$5
    local action=$6
    local benefit=$7
    
    local story_body="
## Story
As a $user_type, I want to $action so that $benefit.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Feature is accessible via UI
- [ ] Feature works correctly
- [ ] Feature has proper error handling
- [ ] Feature is tested
- [ ] Feature is documented

## Technical Notes
- Implement following BMAD standards
- Add appropriate unit tests
- Update API documentation
- Consider performance implications
"
    
    ./github-issue-manager.sh create-story $epic_num "$feature_name" "$story_body" "$epic_slug" "$story_slug"
}

# Create multiple related stories
EPIC_NUM=15
EPIC_SLUG="authentication"

create_user_story $EPIC_NUM "$EPIC_SLUG" "User Profile Management" "user-profile" "registered user" "manage my profile information" "I can keep my account details up to date"

create_user_story $EPIC_NUM "$EPIC_SLUG" "Password Change" "password-change" "registered user" "change my password" "I can maintain account security"

create_user_story $EPIC_NUM "$EPIC_SLUG" "Account Deletion" "account-deletion" "registered user" "delete my account" "I can remove my data when no longer needed"
```

## Configuration

### Core Configuration File

Your `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` should include:

```yaml
github:
  repo: "your-organization/your-repository"
  project_board: "Your Project Board Name"

# Optional: Additional BMAD configuration
prd:
  prdLocation: "docs/prd"
  
architecture:
  architectureLocation: "docs/architecture"
  
qa:
  qaLocation: "docs/qa"
```

### Project Board Setup

The script automatically:
- Creates GitHub Projects v2 board if it doesn't exist
- Links your repository to the project
- Uses default Status field with options: Todo, In Progress, Done
- Sets up proper field mapping for status transitions

### Labels

The script automatically creates and manages these labels:
- `epic` - Applied to all epic issues
- `story` - Applied to all story issues
- `task` - Applied to all task issues
- `epic:{epic_slug}` - Applied to epics and stories with specific epic slug
- `story:{story_slug}` - Applied to stories with specific story slug
- `story-{num}` - Applied to tasks belonging to specific story
- `migrated` - Applied to issues created via migration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "GitHub CLI not authenticated"
```bash
gh auth login
```

#### "core-config.yaml not found"
Ensure you have a `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` file in your project root with proper GitHub configuration.

#### "Invalid repo format"
Ensure your repo is specified as `owner/repository` in the configuration file.

#### "Status field not found in project"
The script expects a default "Status" field in your GitHub project. This is created automatically in new projects.

#### "Failed to create project"
Ensure you have proper permissions in the organization/repository to create projects.

### Debug Mode

For verbose output, you can modify the script to show more details:

```bash
# Add debug output by uncommenting log_info statements
# or redirect stderr to see all log messages
./github-issue-manager.sh create-epic "Test" "Test" 2>&1
```

### Result Validation

You can validate operation results using standard JSON parsing:

```bash
RESULT=$(./github-issue-manager.sh create-epic "Important Epic" "Critical work" "important")
if echo "$RESULT" | jq -e '.epic_number' >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Epic created successfully"
    EPIC_NUM=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.epic_number')
    echo "Epic number: $EPIC_NUM"
else
    echo "Epic creation failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Migration from Individual Scripts

If you were previously using individual scripts from `.bmad-core/scripts/github/`, here's the mapping:

| Old Script | New Command |
|------------|-------------|
| `create-epic-issue.sh` | `create-epic` |
| `create-story-issue.sh` | `create-story` |
| `create-task-issue.sh` | `create-task` |
| `update-issue-status.sh` | `update-status` |
| `list-stories.sh` | `list-stories` |
| `migrate-md-to-issues.sh` | `migrate-stories` |

**Internal Utilities (no longer user commands):**
- `load-config.sh` - Now internal configuration loading
- `ensure-project-board.sh` - Now automatic project board setup
- `create-sub-issue-relationship.sh` - Now automatic relationship creation
- `validate-operation.sh` - Use standard JSON validation tools instead

### Batch Migration Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Replace old script calls with new consolidated commands

# Old way:
# .bmad-core/scripts/github/create-epic-issue.sh "Epic Title" "Epic Body"

# New way:
./github-issue-manager.sh create-epic "Epic Title" "Epic Body" "epic-slug"

# Old way:
# .bmad-core/scripts/github/update-issue-status.sh 42 "In Progress"

# New way:
./github-issue-manager.sh update-status 42 "In Progress"
```
