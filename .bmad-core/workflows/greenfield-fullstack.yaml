    Agent workflow for building full-stack applications from concept to development.
    Supports both comprehensive planning for complex projects and rapid prototyping for simple ones.
  type: greenfield
  project_types:
    - web-app
    - saas
    - enterprise-app
    - prototype
    - mvp

  sequence:
    - agent: analyst
      creates: project-brief.md
      optional_steps:
        - brainstorming_session
        - market_research_prompt
      notes: "Can do brainstorming first, then optional deep research before creating project brief. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final project-brief.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: pm
      creates: prd.md
      requires: project-brief.md
      notes: "Creates PRD from project brief using prd-tmpl. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final prd.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: ux-expert
      creates: front-end-spec.md
      requires: prd.md
      optional_steps:
        - user_research_prompt
      notes: "Creates UI/UX specification using front-end-spec-tmpl. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final front-end-spec.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: ux-expert
      creates: v0_prompt (optional)
      requires: front-end-spec.md
      condition: user_wants_ai_generation
      notes: "OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED: Generate AI UI prompt for tools like v0, Lovable, etc. Use the generate-ai-frontend-prompt task. User can then generate UI in external tool and download project structure."

    - agent: architect
      creates: fullstack-architecture.md
      requires:
        - prd.md
        - front-end-spec.md
      optional_steps:
        - technical_research_prompt
        - review_generated_ui_structure
      notes: "Creates comprehensive architecture using fullstack-architecture-tmpl. If user generated UI with v0/Lovable, can incorporate the project structure into architecture. May suggest changes to PRD stories or new stories. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final fullstack-architecture.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: pm
      updates: prd.md (if needed)
      requires: fullstack-architecture.md
      condition: architecture_suggests_prd_changes
      notes: "If architect suggests story changes, update PRD and re-export the complete unredacted prd.md to docs/ folder."

    - agent: po
      validates: all_artifacts
      uses: po-master-checklist
      notes: "Validates all documents for consistency and completeness. May require updates to any document."

    - agent: various
      updates: any_flagged_documents
      condition: po_checklist_issues
      notes: "If PO finds issues, return to relevant agent to fix and re-export updated documents to docs/ folder."

    - step: project_setup_guidance
      action: guide_project_structure
      condition: user_has_generated_ui
      notes: "If user generated UI with v0/Lovable: For polyrepo setup, place downloaded project in separate frontend repo alongside backend repo. For monorepo, place in apps/web or packages/frontend directory. Review architecture document for specific guidance."

    - step: development_order_guidance
      action: guide_development_sequence
      notes: "Based on PRD stories: If stories are frontend-heavy, start with frontend project/directory first. If backend-heavy or API-first, start with backend. For tightly coupled features, follow story sequence in monorepo setup. Reference sharded PRD epics for development order."

    - agent: po
      action: shard_documents
      creates: sharded_docs
      requires: all_artifacts_in_project
      notes: |
        Shard documents for IDE development:
        - Option A: Use PO agent to shard: @po then ask to shard docs/prd.md
        - Option B: Manual: Drag shard-doc task + docs/prd.md into chat
        - Creates docs/prd/ and docs/architecture/ folders with sharded content

    - step: github_setup
      action: configure_github_integration
      requires: sharded_docs
      notes: |
        GitHub Integration Setup:
        - Ensure core-config.yaml has github.repo configured
        - Verify gh CLI is authenticated (run 'gh auth status')
        - Create project board automatically via github-issue-manager.sh (when creating first issue)
        - Create epic issues from PRD using github-issue-manager.sh create-epic for each epic

    - agent: sm
      action: create_story
      creates: story_issue
      requires: github_setup
      repeats: for_each_epic
      notes: |
        Story creation cycle:
        - SM Agent (New Chat): @sm → *create (or use create-next-story task)
        - Creates next story issue from sharded docs using github-issue-manager.sh create-story
        - Story issue starts with "draft" label in "Backlog" column
        - Creates task sub-issues using github-issue-manager.sh create-task
        - Returns story issue number for tracking

    - agent: analyst/pm
      action: review_draft_story
      updates: story_issue
      requires: story_issue
      optional: true
      condition: user_wants_story_review
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: Review and approve draft story issue
        - Use validate-next-story task with issue number
        - Review story issue completeness and alignment using checklists/story-draft-checklist.md
        - Add validation comment to issue
        - Update issue status: Draft → Ready using github-issue-manager.sh update-status {issue_number} "Ready"
        - Add "validated" label to issue

    - agent: dev
      action: implement_story
      creates: implementation_files
      requires: story_issue
      notes: |
        Dev Agent (New Chat): @dev
        - Uses story issue number to get requirements: gh issue view {issue_number}
        - Implements story and completes task sub-issues
        - Updates File List in issue comments
        - Completes DoD checklist (checklists/story-dod-checklist.md) and adds as comment
        - Updates issue status to "Review" using github-issue-manager.sh update-status {issue_number} "Review"
        - Closes completed task sub-issues

    - agent: qa
      action: review_implementation
      updates: implementation_files
      requires: implementation_files
      optional: true
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: QA Agent (New Chat): @qa → review-story {issue_number}
        - Senior dev review with refactoring ability using tasks/review-story.md
        - Fixes small issues directly
        - Adds QA results as issue comment
        - Updates issue labels and status based on review
        - If approved: github-issue-manager.sh update-status {issue_number} "Done"
        - If changes needed: keeps in "Review" status with feedback

    - agent: dev
      action: address_qa_feedback
      updates: implementation_files
      condition: qa_left_unchecked_items
      notes: |
        If QA left feedback requiring changes:
        - Dev Agent (New Chat): Address QA feedback items from issue comments
        - Update implementation based on QA checklist
        - Return to QA for final approval by commenting on issue

    - step: repeat_development_cycle
      action: continue_for_all_stories
      notes: |
        Repeat story cycle (SM → Dev → QA) for all epic story issues
        Use github-issue-manager.sh list-stories to check for next open stories
        Continue until all story issues in epic are completed (moved to "Done" column)
        Monitor progress via GitHub project board

    - agent: po
      action: epic_retrospective
      creates: epic-retrospective.md
      condition: epic_complete
      optional: true
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: After epic completion
        - NOTE: epic-retrospective task coming soon
        - Validate epic was completed correctly
        - Document learnings and improvements

    - step: workflow_end
      action: project_complete
      notes: |
        All stories implemented and reviewed!
        Project development phase complete.
