  name: Brownfield Full-Stack Enhancement
  description: >-
    Agent workflow for enhancing existing full-stack applications with new features,
    modernization, or significant changes. Handles existing system analysis and safe integration.
  type: brownfield
  project_types:
    - feature-addition
    - refactoring
    - modernization
    - integration-enhancement

  sequence:
    - step: enhancement_classification
      agent: analyst
      action: classify enhancement scope
      notes: |
        Determine enhancement complexity to route to appropriate path:
        - Single story (< 4 hours) → Use brownfield-create-story task
        - Small feature (1-3 stories) → Use brownfield-create-epic task  
        - Major enhancement (multiple epics) → Continue with full workflow

        Ask user: "Can you describe the enhancement scope? Is this a small fix, a feature addition, or a major enhancement requiring architectural changes?"

    - step: routing_decision
      condition: based_on_classification
      routes:
        single_story:
          agent: pm
          uses: brownfield-create-story
          notes: "Create single story for immediate implementation. Exit workflow after story creation."
        small_feature:
          agent: pm
          uses: brownfield-create-epic
          notes: "Create focused epic with 1-3 stories. Exit workflow after epic creation."
        major_enhancement:
          continue: to_next_step
          notes: "Continue with comprehensive planning workflow below."

    - step: documentation_check
      agent: analyst
      action: check existing documentation
      condition: major_enhancement_path
      notes: |
        Check if adequate project documentation exists:
        - Look for existing architecture docs, API specs, coding standards
        - Assess if documentation is current and comprehensive
        - If adequate: Skip document-project, proceed to PRD
        - If inadequate: Run document-project first

    - step: project_analysis
      agent: architect
      action: analyze existing project and use task document-project
      creates: brownfield-architecture.md (or multiple documents)
      condition: documentation_inadequate
      notes: "Run document-project to capture current system state, technical debt, and constraints. Pass findings to PRD creation."

    - agent: pm
      creates: prd.md
      uses: brownfield-prd-tmpl
      requires: existing_documentation_or_analysis
      notes: |
        Creates PRD for major enhancement. If document-project was run, reference its output to avoid re-analysis.
        If skipped, use existing project documentation.
        SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final prd.md to your project's docs/ folder.

    - step: architecture_decision
      agent: pm/architect
      action: determine if architecture document needed
      condition: after_prd_creation
      notes: |
        Review PRD to determine if architectural planning is needed:
        - New architectural patterns → Create architecture doc
        - New libraries/frameworks → Create architecture doc
        - Platform/infrastructure changes → Create architecture doc
        - Following existing patterns → Skip to story creation

    - agent: architect
      creates: architecture.md
      uses: brownfield-architecture-tmpl
      requires: prd.md
      condition: architecture_changes_needed
      notes: "Creates architecture ONLY for significant architectural changes. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final architecture.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: po
      validates: all_artifacts
      uses: po-master-checklist
      notes: "Validates all documents for integration safety and completeness. May require updates to any document."

    - agent: various
      updates: any_flagged_documents
      condition: po_checklist_issues
      notes: "If PO finds issues, return to relevant agent to fix and re-export updated documents to docs/ folder."

    - agent: po
      action: shard_documents
      creates: sharded_docs
      requires: all_artifacts_in_project
      notes: |
        Shard documents for IDE development:
        - Option A: Use PO agent to shard: @po then ask to shard docs/prd.md
        - Option B: Manual: Drag shard-doc task + docs/prd.md into chat
        - Creates docs/prd/ and docs/architecture/ folders with sharded content

    - step: github_setup
      action: configure_github_integration
      requires: sharded_docs
      notes: |
        GitHub Integration Setup:
        - Ensure core-config.yaml has github.repo configured
        - Verify gh CLI is authenticated (run 'gh auth status')
        - Create project board automatically via github-issue-manager.sh (when creating first issue)
        - Create epic issues from PRD using github-issue-manager.sh create-epic for each epic

    - agent: sm
      action: create_story
      creates: story_issue
      requires: github_setup
      repeats: for_each_epic_or_enhancement
      notes: |
        Story creation cycle:
        - For sharded PRD: @sm → *create (uses create-next-story task)
        - For brownfield docs: @sm → use create-brownfield-story task
        - Creates story issue from available documentation using github-issue-manager.sh create-story
        - Story issue starts with "draft" label in "Backlog" column
        - Creates task sub-issues using github-issue-manager.sh create-task
        - May require additional context gathering for brownfield
        - Returns story issue number for tracking

    - agent: analyst/pm
      action: review_draft_story
      updates: story_issue
      requires: story_issue
      optional: true
      condition: user_wants_story_review
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: Review and approve draft story issue
        - Use validate-next-story task with issue number
        - Review story issue completeness and alignment using checklists/story-draft-checklist.md
        - Add validation comment to issue
        - Update issue status: Draft → Ready using github-issue-manager.sh update-status {issue_number} "Ready"
        - Add "validated" label to issue

    - agent: dev
      action: implement_story
      creates: implementation_files
      requires: story_issue
      notes: |
        Dev Agent (New Chat): @dev
        - Uses story issue number to get requirements: gh issue view {issue_number}
        - Implements story and completes task sub-issues
        - Updates File List in issue comments
        - Completes DoD checklist (checklists/story-dod-checklist.md) and adds as comment
        - Updates issue status to "Review" using github-issue-manager.sh update-status {issue_number} "Review"
        - Closes completed task sub-issues

    - agent: qa
      action: review_implementation
      updates: implementation_files
      requires: implementation_files
      optional: true
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: QA Agent (New Chat): @qa → review-story {issue_number}
        - Senior dev review with refactoring ability using tasks/review-story.md
        - Fixes small issues directly
        - Adds QA results as issue comment
        - Updates issue labels and status based on review
        - If approved: github-issue-manager.sh update-status {issue_number} "Done"
        - If changes needed: keeps in "Review" status with feedback

    - agent: dev
      action: address_qa_feedback
      updates: implementation_files
      condition: qa_left_unchecked_items
      notes: |
        If QA left feedback requiring changes:
        - Dev Agent (New Chat): Address QA feedback items from issue comments
        - Update implementation based on QA checklist
        - Return to QA for final approval by commenting on issue

    - step: repeat_development_cycle
      action: continue_for_all_stories
      notes: |
        Repeat story cycle (SM → Dev → QA) for all epic story issues
        Use github-issue-manager.sh list-stories to check for next open stories
        Continue until all story issues in epic are completed (moved to "Done" column)
        Monitor progress via GitHub project board

    - agent: po
      action: epic_retrospective
      creates: epic-retrospective.md
      condition: epic_complete
      optional: true
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: After epic completion
        - NOTE: epic-retrospective task coming soon
        - Validate epic was completed correctly
        - Document learnings and improvements

    - step: workflow_end
      action: project_complete
      notes: |
        All stories implemented and reviewed!
        Project development phase complete.

      - Enhancement requires coordinated stories
      - Architectural changes are needed
      - Significant integration work required
      - Risk assessment and mitigation planning necessary
      - Multiple team members will work on related changes
