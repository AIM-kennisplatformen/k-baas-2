  description: >-
    Agent workflow for enhancing existing frontend applications with new features,
    modernization, or design improvements. Handles existing UI analysis and safe integration.
  type: brownfield
  project_types:
    - ui-modernization
    - framework-migration
    - design-refresh
    - frontend-enhancement

  sequence:
    - step: ui_analysis
      agent: architect
      action: analyze existing project and use task document-project
      creates: multiple documents per the document-project template
      notes: "Review existing frontend application, user feedback, analytics data, and identify improvement areas."

    - agent: pm
      creates: prd.md
      uses: brownfield-prd-tmpl
      requires: existing_ui_analysis
      notes: "Creates comprehensive PRD focused on UI enhancement with existing system analysis. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final prd.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: ux-expert
      creates: front-end-spec.md
      uses: front-end-spec-tmpl
      requires: prd.md
      notes: "Creates UI/UX specification that integrates with existing design patterns. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final front-end-spec.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: architect
      creates: architecture.md
      uses: brownfield-architecture-tmpl
      requires:
        - prd.md
        - front-end-spec.md
      notes: "Creates frontend architecture with component integration strategy and migration planning. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final architecture.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: po
      validates: all_artifacts
      uses: po-master-checklist
      notes: "Validates all documents for UI integration safety and design consistency. May require updates to any document."

    - agent: various
      updates: any_flagged_documents

    - agent: po
      action: shard_documents
      creates: sharded_docs
      requires: all_artifacts_in_project
      notes: |
        Shard documents for IDE development:
        - Option A: Use PO agent to shard: @po then ask to shard docs/prd.md
        - Option B: Manual: Drag shard-doc task + docs/prd.md into chat
        - Creates docs/prd/ and docs/architecture/ folders with sharded content

    - step: github_setup
      action: configure_github_integration
      requires: sharded_docs
      notes: |
        GitHub Integration Setup:
        - Ensure core-config.yaml has github.repo configured
        - Verify gh CLI is authenticated (run 'gh auth status')
        - Create project board if it doesn't exist using scripts/github/ensure-project-board.sh
        - Create epic issues from PRD using scripts/github/create-epic-issue.sh for each epic

    - agent: sm
      action: create_story
      creates: story_issue
      requires: github_setup
      repeats: for_each_epic
      notes: |
        Story creation cycle:
        - SM Agent (New Chat): @sm → *create (or use create-next-story task)
        - Creates next story issue from sharded docs using scripts/github/create-story-issue.sh
        - Story issue starts with "draft" label in "Backlog" column
        - Creates task sub-issues using scripts/github/create-task-issue.sh
        - Returns story issue number for tracking

    - agent: analyst/pm
      action: review_draft_story
      updates: story_issue
      requires: story_issue
      optional: true
      condition: user_wants_story_review
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: Review and approve draft story issue
        - Use validate-next-story task with issue number
        - Review story issue completeness and alignment using checklists/story-draft-checklist.md
        - Add validation comment to issue
        - Update issue status: Draft → Ready using scripts/github/update-issue-status.sh {issue_number} "Ready"
        - Add "validated" label to issue

    - agent: dev
      action: implement_story
      creates: implementation_files
      requires: story_issue
      notes: |
        Dev Agent (New Chat): @dev
        - Uses story issue number to get requirements: gh issue view {issue_number}
        - Implements story and completes task sub-issues
        - Updates File List in issue comments
        - Completes DoD checklist (checklists/story-dod-checklist.md) and adds as comment
        - Updates issue status to "Review" using scripts/github/update-issue-status.sh {issue_number} "Review"
        - Closes completed task sub-issues

    - agent: qa
      action: review_implementation
      updates: implementation_files
      requires: implementation_files
      optional: true
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: QA Agent (New Chat): @qa → review-story {issue_number}
        - Senior dev review with refactoring ability using tasks/review-story.md
        - Fixes small issues directly
        - Adds QA results as issue comment
        - Updates issue labels and status based on review
        - If approved: scripts/github/update-issue-status.sh {issue_number} "Done"
        - If changes needed: keeps in "Review" status with feedback

    - agent: dev
      action: address_qa_feedback
      updates: implementation_files
      condition: qa_left_unchecked_items

        If QA left feedback requiring changes:
        - Dev Agent (New Chat): Address QA feedback items from issue comments
        - Update implementation based on QA checklist
        - Return to QA for final approval by commenting on issue

    - step: repeat_development_cycle
      action: continue_for_all_stories
      notes: |
        Repeat story cycle (SM → Dev → QA) for all epic story issues
        Use scripts/github/list-stories.sh to check for next open stories
        Continue until all story issues in epic are completed (moved to "Done" column)
        Monitor progress via GitHub project board

    - agent: po
      action: epic_retrospective
      creates: epic-retrospective.md
      condition: epic_complete
      optional: true
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: After epic completion
        - NOTE: epic-retrospective task coming soon

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - UI enhancement requires coordinated stories
      - Design system changes needed
      - New component patterns required
      - User research and testing needed
      - Multiple team members will work on related changes
