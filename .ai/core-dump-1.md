- Created and refined project brief based on brainstorming
- Generated deep research prompt for version control in knowledge graphs
- Saved project brief to docs directory

## File System Changes

- **Files Created**: 
  - `docs/knowledge-graph-wiki-project-brief.md` (Complete project brief for Knowledge Graph Wiki Tool)
  - `.ai/` (Directory for core dumps and session persistence)

## Project State

### Knowledge Graph Wiki Tool Concept

A tool for workgroups of experts to create a wiki with knowledge graph integration. Key features:
- Wiki pages attached to entities in a knowledge graph
- Graph visualization with editing capabilities
- TypeDB backend for complex relationships
- LLM assistance for creating relations and content
- Real-time collaboration
- To-do list for incomplete entities/relationships
- Rich text formatting with media embedding

### User Requirements & Preferences

- Target users: Domain experts with limited technical expertise
- UI must be intuitive, minimalistic, and beautiful
- No mode switching (simple vs. advanced)
- System suggestions require explicit user approval
- Real-time collaboration among teams of equals
- Visual manipulation of the knowledge graph
- Schema-based knowledge structure (predefined schemas)

### Rejected Ideas

- Simple/advanced mode toggle
- Template-based approach (using schemas instead)
- Approval workflows for changes
- User-defined "quick create" patterns

### Prioritized Features

- Auto-suggestion of relations and summaries
- Direct manipulation of the graph with bidirectional sync
- Zooming with different detail levels
- Inconsistency/gap identification
- Real-time collaboration
- Version control/history
- Interactive web publishing
- Relationship-centric knowledge
- To-do list for incomplete data

## Next Logical Steps

1. Proceed to Product Manager (Pim) to create a detailed PRD based on the project brief
2. Consider engaging Design Architect (Desiree) for frontend architecture planning
3. Execute the deep research on version control for knowledge graphs
4. Engage Architect (Archie) to create technical architecture

## User Communication Style

- Direct and focused on concrete features
- Provides clear feedback on proposed ideas
- Prefers user agency over system automation
- Values simplicity and intuitiveness in design
- Collaborative approach to ideation
